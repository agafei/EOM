    "\n",
    "1. Use descriptive variable names. The longer your program is, the more important having descriptive names is. (e.g., in real programs, do not name your variables x, y, z, xx, xxx. Use descriptive names like first_fibonacci_term, final_sum, etc.)\n",
    "2. Use \"snake case\" to separate words. Snake case is the convention in Python. (e.g., a variable you want to name \"final sum\" should have the name final_sum, not finalSum, finalsum, FinalSum, etc.)\n",

    "### 1.3: Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that there are a few different types of values we can use in Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers, or ints, are whole numbers (i.e., no decimals).   \n",
    "They are denoted simply as whole numbers. There are no special characters that denote an int.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These are examples of valid ints:  \n",
    "`1`  \n",
    "`23`  \n",
    "`5000629`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats are numbers with decimals.  \n",
    "They are denoted as decimal numbers. The dot indicates that the number is a float and not an int.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These are examples of valid floats:  \n",
    "`4.0`  \n",
    "`3.1415`  \n",
    "`5.`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a sequence of characters. They are surrounded by quotes (single quotes, ', or double quotes, \").  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's not very intuitive when described, so these are examples of valid strings:  \n",
    "`\"Hello world\"`  \n",
    "`\"He\"`  \n",
    "`'Hello world'`  \n",
    "`'H'`  \n",
    "`\" \"`  \n",
    "`\"\"` (Yes, a string can be empty.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that while strings are a very common data type in Python, they are not a _primitive_ (i.e., atomic, indivisible, unsplittable, etc.) data type. (All this means is that they are more complex than numbers and booleans.) In other programming languages, strings are actually a list (or an \"array\") of _characters_, which are the primitive data type. We will tackle strings further later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans represent either true or false. There are only two ways to represent a pure boolean:  \n",
    "`True`  \n",
    "`False`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to turn a variable from one data type to another, you can use a constructor function to do so. This process is called _casting_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common constructors that you might use:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`int()`  \n",
    "`float()`  \n",
    "`str()`  \n",
    "`bool()` (not used as often as the others.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "`int(\"3\")` => `3`  \n",
    "`string(402)` => `\"402\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this will not work for all cases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "`int(\"Hello\")` will yield an error.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Things to remember\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generally, do not mix data types. It can be done sometimes, but it will give you a headache.\n",
    "2. It is advisable to know what data type a variable will hold before doing operations on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no checkpoint exercise for this part, but it will be foundational for the next part."

    "\n",
    "Strings are not a \"primitive\" data type, but they are such a common data type that we must discuss how to deal with them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These ways of dealing with strings will make more sense when we discuss _lists_ in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concatenating strings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can _concatenate_ (read: join) strings with the + operator.  \n",
    "`\"Hello\" + \" \" + \"world!\"` => `\"Hello world!\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formatting strings\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to construct a string from many variables, you can use a template called an f-string (format string).  \n",
    "A format string is a string preceded by an `f`. Variables are placed in between curly brackets {}.  \n",
    "`a = 10`  \n",
    "`b = 15`  \n",
    "`f\"a is {a}, b is {b}, and their sum is {a + b}.\"` => `\"a is 10, b is 15, and their sum is 25.\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Slicing\" strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are lists of characters. You can \"pick out\" a character by specifying the _index_ of the character within the string.  \n",
    "Please note that indexes start at `0`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`\"Hello world!\"[0]` => `\"H\"`  \n",
    "`\"Hello world!\"[1]` => `\"e\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can select a \"substring\" by specifying the start index (inclusive) and the end index (exclusive) of your desired substring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`\"Hello world!\"[0:5]` => `\"Hello\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can select from the _end_ of a string by using negative numbers. Negative indexes start at `-1` and descend from there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`\"Hello world!\"[-1]` => `\"!\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting the length of a string  \n",
